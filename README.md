- I have tried these three DEs

  - Gnome
  - KDE
  - XFCE

- First time trying Gnome with Ubuntu (downloaded ISO from website and install~), it's so pretty and most compatible with my devices, smoothing experience aka Memory waster

- I had decided to move to Debian KDE Plasma (after watching the comparison video of some guys on Youtube), which was overwhelming with the ability to customize KDE features, and it's more lightweight than Gnome xD

- XFCE seems to fit with my X220 (4GB, 128GB 2.5inch SSD, i5 2th) but it lacks the functions that I need

**[Update: 20 June 24]**: Seem i have fall in love with the ricing process, i'm using bspwm and i3 now :) should i move to Arch with Hyperland xD

**[Update: 24 June 24]**: Back to using Gnome Debian (there some issue with my KDE + bspwm), but another session still bspwm xD

**[Update 30 June 24]**: I have moved to Arch with Hyprland, my first time using Arch, and it's so fun to rice my system xD
